## Total Phase Reconstruction 

This repository contains the source code for simulating total phase reconstruction [1] in adjacent 1D Bose gases from 
density ripple data after free expansion (time-of-flight [2]). It also contains the code for analyzing selected experimental data:
relaxation dynamics after driving in Luttinger liquids and non-Gaussian decay and recurrence [3]. Some raw data are not included but
can be regenerated with the given scripts.
